## Introduction
This is the first assignment from Viviek Rmachandran SLAE32 course.<br>
The first part of the assignment request to create a Shell_Bind_TCP shellcode with these properties:
- Binds to a port 
- Execs Shell on incoming connecton

The second part request to create a script to make port number easily configurable.<br>
According with +[Infosec Institute](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/icmp-reverse-shell/),
> *Bind shell is a type of shell in which the target machine opens up a communication port or a listener on the victim machine and waits for an incoming connection. The attacker then connects to the victim machineâ€™s listener which then leads to code or command execution on the server.*
