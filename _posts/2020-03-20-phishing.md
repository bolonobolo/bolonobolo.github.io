## Introduction
Due to recent events about COVID-19 some Health Centers in Europe fall victims of ramsonware attacks. The first channel to spread ransomware is phishing so here are some suggestions to block surfing to phishing sites in the bad way you have clicked on the phishing link in the email.
I installed sometimnes ago the Pihole Ad Blocking on my Raspberry Pi, to avoid the annoiyng commercials AD when i surfing the net from home. But the Pihole could has more powerfull applications for example adding other types of blacklist to the Pihole, phishing site black list could be one of this blacklists.

## The chain
The chain to follow to transform your Pihole in a DNS that block phishing link is preatty easy:

- first you have to download and install the Pihole, there are full of guide in internet depending on where you want to install it, [here's one for Raspberry](https://blog.cryptoaustralia.org.au/instructions-for-setting-up-pi-hole/)    
- second you have to add the phishing list to the adlist.list of your Pihole istallation
- third you have to update your Gravity list 
- done

As said the first step is pretty simple and is out of the scope of this post (ping me if you are in trouble with the installation), so skip directly to the second point. 

### Add phishing list
I recently found a very good project that update a phishing blacklist every 6 hours. This list could be implemented in the Pihole to block phishing sites.
It is called [Phishing Army](https://phishing.army/) and it updates its lists directly from 3 sources:
-[Phishtank](https://www.phishtank.com/)
-[Openphis](https://openphish.com/)
-[PhishFindR](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Phishing.Database)  

The first thing to do is to report and vote for phishing sites, the easy way is to follow the instruction wrote on the amazing blog of the [Cyberv19 volunteers](https://cyberv19.org.uk/2020/03/20/helping-the-fight-against-phishing/) about voting system on Phishtank.
When the link reach a good number of votes it is marked as phishing, it will finish in the blacklist update of Phishing Army and automatically inside your Pihole.

### Add Phishing Army blacklist to your Pihole
To add the Phishing Army black list to your Pihole just simply add the list to the list in the ```adlist.list``` file in your Pihole installation.
Just connect to the Pihole via ssh and type this command

```bash
# vim /etc/pihole/adlists.list
```
paste the link at the bottom of your list file, write and quit.

Now you have to update the Gravity black list by typing the command
```bash
# pihole -g
```

### Checks
Now you can check if your Pihole is blocking malicious DNS requests.
Search for a full or partial link in the Query Lists Search of the Pihole

Try to surf one of the links appeared in the results and see the DNS query blocked by the Pihole.

Well done!
