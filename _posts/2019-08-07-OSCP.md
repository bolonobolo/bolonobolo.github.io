## Prologue
Hey, if you are here is because you're thinking to take the PWK/OSCP certification. 
This certification is not only for who wants to start him path in the infosec work environment, but i think, it is a very beautiful challange for mind and body, for you whatever age you have, for you that wants to break the work or life routine.
PWK/OSCP course needs a lot of abnegation, hours spents to study the concepts learned in the lessons, to complete the lab and to review arguments.
This certification introduce you in the penetration test world, but most in general in the infosec enviroment, with a very practical approach, otherwise others certtifications.
In this journey you'll feel pain and happiness, despair and exaltation sometimes at a distance of few minutes from each other. In other words, your soul will shake you.
The OffSec motto is "Try Harder" that is really appropriate. My motto is "if i done this, you can do it".
Peoples often thinks that infosec certifications needs a lot of experience in Informatic to obtains it. It is not true, well not at all.
I tell you, this certification is not an entry level: OSCP needs some knowledge on a lot of arguments, from scripting to networking, from web programming languages to system administration, that said the materials composed of videos and a PDF, give you all the informations and all the arguments that you have to study if you dont't know what the videos talking about.
In particular you need to know basics on this fields:
- Linux systems
- Windows Server systems
- bash programming
- python programming
- TCP/IP basics
- networking basics
- cryptography basics
- Web languages like PHP help too
