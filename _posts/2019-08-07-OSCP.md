## The catapult launch
Hey, if you are here is because you're thinking to take the PWK/OSCP certification. Well, i could say you only you are on the right path.
This certification is not only for who wants to start him path in the infosec work environment, but it i think, it is a very beautiful challange for mind and body, for you whatever age you have, for you that wants to break the work or life routine.
In this journey you'll feel pain and happiness, despair and exaltation sometimes at a distance of few minutes from each other. In other words, your soul will shake you. So if you're still reading at this point, load the catapult, jump in the bucket, become the payload, point and click.
